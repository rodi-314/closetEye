# ClosetEye

ClosetEye focuses on tackling the issue of fast fashion and clothing overconsumption, as well as outfit preparation, as a result of disorganised wardrobes. It is a smart wardrobe that tracks your clothing and provides outfit suggestions based on your preferences and schedules. It consists of an IoT RFID module and an accompanying mobile app, that tracks wardrobe items with RFID stickers attached to them, and suggests outfit combinations for the user based on machine learning. For more information and details about the project, view the project poster [here](<Project Poster.pdf>) or the preliminary design video [here](<https://youtu.be/kQmtjnLqJL8?feature=shared>).
